bio: |
  Always in beta: learning and evolving.
  
  I am currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science at the University of Georgia, 
  under the guidance of Prof. Jian Liu. I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from 
  Georgia State University (GPA: 4.0/4.0) under the supervision of Prof. Qin Hu.
  
  Prior to this, I was a member of the Qiushi Class (求是班), a joint program with 
  Zhejiang University, at NingboTech University, where I was mentored by Prof. Chaoyi Pang.
  
  My research focuses on LLM Security & Privacy, Trustworthy AI, and 3D Vision/Reconstruction.
