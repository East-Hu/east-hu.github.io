  <div class="tagline-box"><em>Always in beta: learning and evolving.</em></div>

  I am currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science at the [University of Georgia](https://computing.uga.edu/), under the guidance of [Dr. Jian Liu](https://mosis.uga.edu/jianliu/). I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia State University under the supervision of [Dr. Qin Hu](https://qinhu2010.github.io/).

  My current research focuses on how to protect human voices from being cloned by AI. I've previously focused on security in multimodal large language models and federated learning. You can check out my recent publications on my Research page.

  I love sports and music. Lately, I've been really into [zone 2 training](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/zone-2-training-for-endurance-athletes/), which has been great for lowering my blood pressure. I'm a huge fan of Liverpool Football Club and the Golden State Warriors. I also spent two months at Queen's University Belfast in the UK for a summer school program, and that was one of the happiest times of my life.
