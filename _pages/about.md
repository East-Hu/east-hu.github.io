<span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif;">I am currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia State University, under the guidance of Assistant Professor [Qin Hu](https://qinhu2010.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Technology at NingboTech University, where I was mentored by Professor [Chaoyi Pang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=PZZ9jIEAAAAJ&hl=en). </span>

<span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif;">During my undergraduate years, I conducted research in foundational algorithms and represented my university in several international programming competitions (ICPC), earning various awards.</span>
